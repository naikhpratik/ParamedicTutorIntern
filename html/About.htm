		<p>The Paramedic Tutor was written to help any paramedic improve their skills, knowledge, and ability in the field of paramedicine. This app was created by practicing paramedics who have direct experience providing patient care, teaching other paramedics, and taking high stakes exams like the NREMT-P (NRP). The goal of this app is to have a resource where paramedics can come to learn new information, review tricky material, or take a look at real life EKG’s. Paramedic Tutor comes with several ways to interact with the material to enhance learning. There are multiple choice questions, flashcards, scenarios, and an EKG quiz. Throughout the app, special attention has been paid to Airway, Cardiology, Pediatrics, OBGYN, and EKG’s. These are the areas that are tested most often on national exams, because these patient types can be rare. The questions are not designed to trick, but they are designed around the best answer. Weather you are brushing up on skills, taking the NREMT-P (NRP), or taking a job-placement exam, this app can help you. Enjoy!

	    <p><strong>This app has some features that we think are pretty cool:</strong></p>
        <p><strong><u>Bookmarking</u>:</strong>While taking a quiz or looking at flashcards, we offer the ability to bookmark a question or flashcard for later review. If you find that you are repeatedly missing a certain question or if you are unaware of the reason for an answer, you have the ability to bookmark the question and later review it for a more effective learning experience.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Explanations</u>:</strong> Learning is the end result that we hope to produce. To provide our students with an optimal learning experience, we provide detailed explanations for why certain answers are correct, as well as descriptions of why other answers are incorrect.</p>
        
        <p><strong><u>DISCLAIMER</u>:</strong>Unfortunately, we are not without our mistakes. While we promise to continually hone and refine the material in this app, there may still be errors. While in the field, you should rely on your training and on the protocols and procedures under which you work.</p>
    
        <p>We hope that you enjoy the experience of the Paramedic Tutor. If you have material that you think would help others pass the NREMT-P (NRP) or excel on the job, our content writers are always willing to review any material. If you find an error, please contact us with your thoughts and we will certainly review it.</p>
